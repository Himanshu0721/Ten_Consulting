              Our online Subscription Service allows us to create and share

              their own marketing, lead generation, and customer service needs,
              and we use the same for our business requirements. We use our own
              Subscription Service to build web pages that people can visit to
              learn more about TEN. Information that we collect and manage using
              the Subscription Service belongs to us and is used, disclosed, and
